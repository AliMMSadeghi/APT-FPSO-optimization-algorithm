## Overview
This repository features the Adaptive Particularly Tunable Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization (APT-FPSO) algorithm, an advanced variant of the standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Utilizing fuzzy logic, APT-FPSO adaptively tunes the learning coefficients for each particle at every iteration, enhancing the algorithm's balance between exploration and exploitation. The repository focuses on a single benchmark function, Griewangk, and demonstrates APT-FPSO’s effectiveness through detailed statistical analysis. This implementation is ideal for exploring the algorithm’s capabilities in complex optimization scenarios that require robust performance. For more detailed information, please read this [paper](https://ijfs.usb.ac.ir/article_5111.html). You can also find the PDF version of the paper in the repository.

## Features
- Four different versions of the APT-FPSO algorithm are provided with different rule-base structures.
- The repository focuses on a single benchmark function, Griewangk.
